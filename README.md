# Automatic inventory icon cleaner #

Live demo [here](https://mabi.world/icon/)

## TODO ##

* Ability to select inventory slots that contain the icon graphically. (Overlay on pasted image.)
* Update preview as you mouse over selections in color selectors.
* Ability to select pixels that should be preserved (but that would otherwise be erased.)
* Image uploader and paste image URL options.
* GIF support with image uploader (easy to figure out icon in this form!)
* Direct upload to MWW
* Better readme
