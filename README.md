# Automatic inventory icon cleaner #
Live demo [here](https://mabi.world/icon/)

## TODO ##
* Searching for grid color needs to be a lot better, and it needs to fail more gracefully.
	* Additionally, if a color is already set in the corrections, it should check to see if it exists in the image. If it does, it can use it. Only overwrite it if it doesn't.
* Ability to select inventory slots that contain the icon graphically. (Overlay on pasted image.)
* Show color you're currently hovering over in inner color select.
* Update preview as you mouse over selections in color selectors.
* Add grid color selector.
* Ability to select pixels that should be preserved (but that would otherwise be erased.)
* Image uploader and paste image URL options.
* GIF support with image uploader (easy to figure out icon in this form!)
* Direct upload to MWW
* Better readme
